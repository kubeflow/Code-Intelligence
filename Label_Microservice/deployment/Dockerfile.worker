# Skaffold hack
# Skaffold infers the files to watch for changes by parsing the dockerfile 
# and looking for COPY statements. Skaffold v1.1.0 doesn't appear to detect
# changes to directories so we add explicit COPY statements for the files that
# we want to retrigger skaffold on when they are modified
# TODO(jlewi): Need to try removing this. I think the problem might have been I was out of
# notify resources on my local machine. When I switched skaffold to use --notify=polling
# it started to detect changes.
